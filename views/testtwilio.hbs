            The answer to a more peaceful world isn't straightforward but it exists. It lies within every single one of us. At Wirlix, our vision is to empower every individual to find their passion and find themselves through a social media debate platform. It may sound wierd, but we believe that sparking controversy leads to a more empathetic and open-minded individual and ultimately progress. We're creating an environment where people are defined by more than a selfie on instagram and reposted video. You are defined by your passions, dreams, beliefs and visions for the world. Whatever you care about: animal rights, world hunger, racism, the education system, gender equality, or even weed, with Wirlix we aren't just showing you the world's affairs. We are opening a world of possibilities where you can now take action and find creative solutions to these matters by doing what you love and speaking up. We all live in one world. Let's cease this trend of isolating ourselves and lets end the hate and come together. Unite as one world. Social media has the power to enlighten a generation and that's Wirlix. Don't believe it.. Let us show you.
